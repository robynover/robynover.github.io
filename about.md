I’m a web developer and technology teacher. I specialize in PHP and Javascript. 

I teach web development in many different contexts, from corporate trainings to university courses to one-on-one tutoring. I’m currently an adjunct faculty member at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications program. From 2009 to 2013, I taught online PHP courses for Zend Technologies.

I have a Master’s degree from New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, or ITP. ITP is a unique program that fuses technology and art, and encourages students to follow their curiosity, to jump in and get their hands on tools to build their ideas. While I was there, I learned to program microcontrollers. I built interactive projects in Java (and its clever off-spring, Processing), PHP, MySQL and so forth, and I also worked with clay, plaster, wood, aluminum, and plexiglass.

I come to technology from a background as a writer. I studied poetry and wrote poems. My undergraduate degree is in Creative Writing and I did some graduate work in Poetry at The City College of New York. My focus was in formal verse — poems in traditional forms such as the sonnet and sestina.

I still maintain that formal poetry and computer code have a lot in common with each other. I think they are beautiful in similar ways. When I first learned HTML back in the day, I found a symmetrical beauty similar to that of the sonnet.

I live in Brooklyn, New York. Contact me at robynover at gmail.
